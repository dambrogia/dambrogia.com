        Located in the San Francisco Bay Area, Iâ€™m working remotely as the Principal Software Architect for Palmetto State Armory E-Commerce team. I have the usual love for nerding out on the computer and reading Reddit or Medium articles about DevOps and Software Architecture. In my free time you can find me watching or playing basketball and riding anything with two wheels.
